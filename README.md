## JSONParserP5 ##
This processing library is intended to greatly simply the way you fetch open data exposed as JSON. 
As you know, most of the social networks expose such data as JSON. The library is independant of 
any other external API or library. Therefore once you extract the content of the archive to your 
library folder inside your sketchbook, you are ready to go.

## Example ##
The library comes with an example that would fetch latest tweets belonging to OpenSourceTwitter handle 
(TwitterOSS) and the list of github repos belonging to Processing.org. A screen from the example can be 
seen below.
